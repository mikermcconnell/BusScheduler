## Key Types & File Formats

### Core Types
- **Schedule Types** (`src/types/schedule.ts`): `TimePoint`, `Trip`, `ProcessedSchedule`, `ValidationResult`
- **Workflow Types** (`src/types/workflow.ts`): `WorkflowDraft`, `BlockConfiguration`, `ServiceBand`, `DayType`
- **Connection Types** (`src/types/connectionOptimization.ts`): `ConnectionPoint`, `RecoveryBankResult`, `OptimizationConstraints`
- **Event Types** (`src/types/workspaceEvents.ts`): `WorkspaceEvent`, `WorkspaceEventInput` (discriminated unions)

### Input: Raw Data CSV
- **Structure**: Route segments with travel time percentiles by 30-minute periods
- **Data Rows**: 25%/50%/80%/90% observed runtimes + scheduled targets
- **Example**: `101 CCW Observed Runtime-50%` for median travel times

### Output: Summary Schedule Excel
- **Professional Layout**: Timepoint columns, departure/arrival times, block organization
- **Industry Standard**: GTFS-compatible format for transit operators
- **Operational Data**: Recovery times, cycle times, service bands

## Security Features ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **File Validation**: MIME type + magic byte verification, size limits (5MB max, 1KB min)
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML entity encoding, attack pattern detection
- **Memory Protection**: 50MB limit, processing timeouts (30s), circuit breaker pattern
- **Input Sanitization**: Length limits, character filtering, secure error handling

## Navigation & Workflow
**Main Flow**: Dashboard → Upload Schedule → TimePoints Analysis → Block Configuration → Summary Schedule → Export

### Key Pages
- **Dashboard** (`/`) - Main landing page with recent drafts and quick actions
- **Upload** (`/upload`) - File processing with drag/drop
- **TimePoints** (`/timepoints`) - Interactive travel time analysis, service bands, outlier detection
- **Block Configuration** (`/block-configuration`) - Duolingo-style UI for bus block management
- **Block Summary Schedule** (`/block-summary-schedule`) - Professional display with inline editing
- **Connection Optimization** (`/connection-optimization`) - Recovery time optimization configuration
- **Visual Dashboard** (`/visual-dashboard`) - Optimization results and timeline visualization
- **Draft Library** (`/draft-library`) - Manage saved drafts and workflows
- **Settings** (`/settings`) - Application settings and preferences

## Bus Block Configuration System
### Duolingo-Style UI Features
- **Pill-shaped cards** with colorful gradients and 3D shadows
- **Smart automation**: Block 1 manual, Blocks 2+ auto-calculated (frequency intervals)
- **Safety limits**: Max 50 trips/block, 500 total trips, 1000 iterations

### Configuration Options
- **Number of Buses** (1-10) - Dynamic block creation
- **Cycle Time** (minutes) - User-configurable, unrestricted
- **Service Frequency** - Auto-calculated (Cycle Time ÷ Buses)
- **Automated Start Times** - Toggle control (default ON)

## Summary Schedule System
### Professional Transit Display
- **Industry Layout**: Timepoint columns matching professional schedules
- **Service Bands**: Color-coded (Fastest=Green, Standard=Orange, Slowest=Red)
- **Time Logic**: Origin=departure, Intermediate=arrival+departure, Destination=arrival

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Full Screen Synchronization
**IMPORTANT**: The `BlockSummarySchedule.tsx` component has TWO display modes:
1. **Normal View**: Standard table display
2. **Full Screen View**: Same table in full screen overlay (`isFullscreen` state)

**Both modes use the same `TripRow` component**, so changes automatically sync. However, always verify both views when making UI/UX modifications to time cells, click targets, or table styling.

### Inline Editing & Cascading Updates
- **Click-to-Edit**: Recovery times with auto-select input
- **Real-time Cascading**: Changes propagate within trip, then to subsequent trips in block
- **Persistence**: localStorage + Firebase sync
- **Recovery Templates**: Service band templates with bulk application

## Service Band Logic
### Trip-Specific Assignment
```typescript
const tripServiceBand = getServiceBandForTime(departureTime, timePeriodBands);
const segmentTime = tripServiceBand.segmentTimes[segmentIndex];
```

### Categories & Examples
- **Fastest** (Green): 35min travel + 9min recovery = 44min total
- **Fast** (Light Green): 37-38min total
- **Standard** (Orange): 39min total  
- **Slow** (Orange): 40min total
- **Slowest** (Red): 41min+ total

## Schedule Statistics
### Display Order & Calculations
1. **Total Trip Time** - Complete journey time (sum of Trip Time column)
2. **Total Travel Time** - Pure movement time (sum of Travel Time column)
3. **Total Recovery Time** - Cumulative dwell time (sum of Recovery Time column)
4. **Average Recovery %** - `(Recovery ÷ Travel) × 100`
5. **Total Trips** - Active trip count


## Firebase Integration
### Setup & Data Structure
```
/schedules/{id}: userId, routeName, status, tripCount, summarySchedule, timestamps
/draft_schedules/{id}: userId, fileName, uploadedData, processingStep, timestamps
```

### Features
- **Cloud backup**, **cross-device sync**, **offline support**
- **User authentication** (email/password, Google, anonymous)
- **Seamless migration** from localStorage

### Magic Link Authentication Setup
**Note**: Firebase Dynamic Links deprecated August 2025 - use direct email links instead

#### Configuration Steps:
1. **Firebase Console Settings**:
   - Enable Email/Password authentication in Sign-in methods
   - Toggle ON "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" option
   - Add authorized domains: `localhost`, your production domain

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_MAGIC_LINK_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000  # For development
   ```

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User enters email → Firebase sends magic link
   - Link directs to `/auth/email-link` on your domain
   - `EmailLinkHandler` component processes authentication
   - No Dynamic Links required - works with direct domain URLs

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions
```typescript
// Core Services
processSchedule(file: File): Promise<ProcessedSchedule>
generateTrips(config: BlockConfiguration[]): Trip[]
calculateTravelTimes(timePoints: TimePoint[]): TravelMatrix

// Draft Management
draftService.saveWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowDraft): void
draftService.loadWorkflow(draftId: string): WorkflowDraft | null
draftService.getActiveDraft(): string | null

// Connection Optimization
optimizeConnections(schedule: Schedule, constraints: OptimizationConstraints): OptimizedSchedule
calculateRecoveryBank(trips: Trip[]): RecoveryBankResult
evaluateConnectionWindows(trips: Trip[], connections: ConnectionPoint[]): WindowAnalysis

// Time Utilities
timeToMinutes(timeStr: string): number
minutesToTime(minutes: number): string
addMinutes(timeStr: string, minutes: number): string
detectRoutePattern(schedule: Schedule): RoutePattern

// Security
sanitizeString(input: string): string
validateFileUpload(file: File): ValidationResult
detectAttackPatterns(input: string): boolean
```

### Cascading Update Logic
```typescript
// Core algorithm
nextTrip.startTime = previousTrip.departureTime;
departureTime = arrivalTime + recoveryTime;

if (recoveryTimeChanged) {
  updateCurrentTripSubsequentStops();
  updateAllSubsequentTripsInBlock();
  refreshScheduleDisplay();
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Performance Boundaries
- **< 100 trips**: Standard rendering
- **100-500 trips**: Optional virtualization
- **500+ trips**: Required virtualization
- **Memory limits**: 4MB localStorage, 50MB processing

### Security Checklist
- Always validate file uploads with existing functions
- Sanitize inputs before processing/display
- Monitor memory usage during operations
- Use secure error handling

### Common Gotchas
1. **Recovery vs Travel Time**: Recovery = dwell time, Travel = movement time
2. **Cascading Logic**: Update current trip first, then cascade if last stop changed
3. **Time Format**: Use "07:00" (24-hour), not "7:00 AM"
4. **Block Boundaries**: Only cascade within same block number

## Testing Strategy
### Test Data Location: `test-data/`
- `small-schedule.csv` (10 trips), `medium-schedule.csv` (100 trips)
- `large-schedule.csv` (1000 trips), `edge-cases.csv`, `malformed.csv`

### Edge Cases
- Empty/malformed CSV, files > 5MB, negative travel times
- 24-hour wraparound, circular routes, express services
- XSS payloads, path traversal, buffer overflow attempts

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Issues
- "Format not supported" → Check extension + MIME type
- "File too large" → 5MB limit enforced
- "Processing timeout" → 30-second limit

### Performance Issues
- Browser freezing → Enable virtualization
- Slow rendering → Check memoization
- Export failures → Browser memory limits

### Debug Commands
```javascript
console.log(scheduleStorage.getAllSchedules()); // Check data
localStorage.clear(); // Reset storage
console.log(performance.memory); // Monitor memory
```

## Architecture Diagrams

### Schedule Generation Flow
```
CSV Upload → Format Detection → TimePoint Analysis → Service Bands
    ↓             ↓                    ↓                 ↓
Validation → Auto-detect Headers → Block Config → Summary Schedule → Export
```

### Cascading Updates
```
User edits recovery → Update stop departure → Cascade within trip
                                ↓
                        Is last stop changed?
                           ↓         ↓
                         No        Yes → Update next trip → Cascade to block
```

## Agentic Coding Best Practices

### Recommended Approach (Auto-Selection)
**Trigger**: "Recommended approach: [task description]"
**Purpose**: Automatically analyzes task and applies the most suitable methodology

```bash
# Examples
"Recommended approach: Add user profile editing"     # Will likely use TDD
"Recommended approach: Optimize dashboard loading"   # Will use performance-optimizer
"Recommended approach: Refactor payment system"      # Will use Task Think
"Recommended approach: Build chat with encryption"   # Will use Router + Security
```

**How it works**: Analyzes task complexity, scope, and requirements to select:
- TDD for new features with clear requirements
- Task Think for complex refactoring or multi-file changes
- Task Router for uncertain scope or multi-domain tasks
- Combined approaches for critical or complex features

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Trigger**: "Test-Driven Development: [feature]" or "TDD: [feature]"
**Pattern**: Tests First → Red → Green → Refactor → Review

```bash
# Example commands
"TDD: Add user authentication"           # Writes tests first, then implementation
"Run tests to confirm failures"          # Verify red state
"Implement to pass tests"                # Minimal code to green
"Review TDD implementation"              # Quality check
```

### Task Think Workflow
**Trigger**: "Task Think: [complex task]" or when dealing with multi-file changes
**Pattern**: Explore → Plan → Implement → Integrate

```bash
# Example commands
"Task Think: Refactor authentication"    # Deep analysis before coding
"Task Think harder: [complex task]"      # Extra depth for complex features
```

**Key Rules**:
- Always explore codebase first (Read, Glob, Grep)
- Use sequential-thinking for planning
- Track with TodoWrite throughout
- No premature coding

### Task Router Agent
**Trigger**: "Route this task: [description]" or when unsure which agent to use
**Purpose**: Automatically assigns specialized agents

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Frontend | ui-engineer | React components, UI/UX |
| Backend | backend-implementer | APIs, services, logic |
| Database | firebase-specialist | Firestore, queries |
| Testing | test-engineer | Test suites, coverage |
| Performance | performance-optimizer | Speed, memory, rendering |
| Security | security-specialist | Validation, XSS, auth |
| Planning | planner-agent | Feature breakdown |
| Review | code-reviewer | Quality assurance |

### Combined Methodologies
```bash
"Task Think with TDD: OAuth implementation"        # Analysis + test-first
"Route this TDD task: Payment processing"         # Auto-assign + test-first
"Task Think with routing: Dashboard redesign"     # Full systematic approach
```

### Quick Decision Guide
- **New features**: Use TDD
- **Complex refactoring**: Use Task Think
- **Uncertain scope**: Use Task Router
- **Critical changes**: Task Think + TDD
- **Multi-domain**: Router + TDD

### Quality Gates
Always include:
- test-engineer for coverage
- code-reviewer for final check
- security-specialist for sensitive ops
- performance-optimizer for data-heavy features

## Clarification Protocol - No Assumptions Policy

### Core Principle: **ASK DON'T ASSUME**

When any agent or Claude encounters ambiguity, uncertainty, or missing information, **ALWAYS clarify with the user** instead of making assumptions.

### When to Request Clarification

#### 1. **Technical Ambiguity**
```bash
❌ BAD: "I'll assume you want the latest version"
✅ GOOD: "Which version would you like me to install - latest stable (7.3.2) or keep current (7.3.1)?"

❌ BAD: "I'll use the default configuration"  
✅ GOOD: "Should I use the existing configuration or would you prefer different settings?"
```

#### 2. **Scope Uncertainty** 
```bash
❌ BAD: "I'll update all related files"
✅ GOOD: "I found 5 related files. Should I update all of them or specific ones?"

❌ BAD: "I'll implement this feature completely"
✅ GOOD: "This feature has multiple parts (UI, API, tests). Which parts should I focus on?"
```

#### 3. **User Intent**
```bash
❌ BAD: "I'll fix this the standard way"
✅ GOOD: "I see two approaches: quick fix vs comprehensive refactor. Which do you prefer?"

❌ BAD: "I'll add the typical security measures"
✅ GOOD: "What level of security should I implement - basic validation or comprehensive hardening?"
```

#### 4. **Breaking Changes**
```bash
❌ BAD: "This might break compatibility but I'll proceed"
✅ GOOD: "This change could affect X, Y, Z. Should I proceed or use a safer approach?"

❌ BAD: "I'll migrate to the new API"
✅ GOOD: "Migrating to the new API will change how authentication works. Is this the right time?"
```

### Clarification Templates

#### For Technical Decisions:
```
"I need to clarify: [specific technical choice]. 
Options: 
A) [Option 1 with pros/cons]
B) [Option 2 with pros/cons]
Which would you prefer?"
```

#### For Scope Questions:
```
"I found [number] of [items] that could be affected:
- [List items]
Should I update all of these or just specific ones?"
```

#### For Risk Assessment:
```
"This change could impact:
- [Impact 1]
- [Impact 2]
Risk level: [High/Medium/Low]
Should I proceed or explore alternatives?"
```

### Implementation Rules

#### For All Agents:
1. **Pause before assumptions** - If uncertain, stop and ask
2. **Be specific** - Ask about exact requirements, not general intent
3. **Provide context** - Explain why the clarification is needed
4. **Offer options** - Give 2-3 clear alternatives when possible
5. **Acknowledge uncertainty** - It's better to be honest about limits

#### For Complex Tasks:
1. **Break down ambiguity** - Identify each unclear aspect
2. **Prioritize questions** - Ask most critical clarifications first
3. **Suggest defaults** - "If no preference, I recommend X because..."
4. **Confirm understanding** - Repeat back what you understood

### Examples in Practice

#### Dependency Updates:
```
❌ "I'll update all your dependencies to the latest versions"
✅ "I found 15 packages that can be updated. Should I:
   A) Update only patch versions (safer)
   B) Update minor versions (new features)
   C) Let you review each one individually?"
```

#### Code Changes:
```
❌ "I'll refactor this to use modern patterns"
✅ "I can refactor this using:
   A) React hooks (requires testing changes)
   B) Keep class components (minimal changes)
   Which fits your timeline better?"
```

#### File Operations:
```
❌ "I'll create the necessary files"
✅ "I need to create files for this feature. Should I:
   - Create in src/components/ (standard location)
   - Create in src/features/newFeature/ (organized approach)
   - Check with you on the structure first?"
```

### Override Conditions

**Only make assumptions when:**
1. **Explicitly documented** - CLAUDE.md has clear guidance
2. **Industry standard** - Universally accepted best practice
3. **No risk** - Cannot break anything or cause issues
4. **Time critical** - User indicated urgency and provided constraints

**Always clarify when:**
- User requirements are ambiguous
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Changes could affect other parts of the system
- Breaking changes are involved
- Security implications exist
- Performance trade-offs are required

## TypeScript Architecture & Agent Guidelines

### Type Architecture Overview
The codebase uses sophisticated TypeScript patterns that require careful handling:

**Core Type System:**
- **Discriminated Unions**: `WorkspaceEvent` (11 event types) with strict type-payload relationships
- **Complex Interfaces**: Schedule, Trip, TimePoint hierarchies with cross-references
- **Union Input Types**: `WorkspaceEventInput` preserves type safety for event emission
- **Service Integration**: Firebase, React Context, and testing utilities all typed

### Critical Type Files (READ FIRST)
```
src/types/workspaceEvents.ts      # Event system discriminated unions
src/types/schedule.ts             # Core domain types
src/types/workflow.ts             # Draft and block configuration
src/types/connectionOptimization.ts # Connection optimization types
src/types/export.ts               # Export format definitions
```

### Agent Type-First Protocols

#### 1. Pre-Change Type Analysis
**ALWAYS do this before any code changes:**
```bash
# Read related type definitions
# Understand discriminated union structure
# Check existing component prop interfaces
# Validate context provider patterns
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Guidelines

**Event System Changes:**
- Read `workspaceEvents.ts` first to understand union structure
- Use proper discriminated union patterns: `event.type === 'data-validation'`
- Never mix payload types between different event variants
- Event emission must match `WorkspaceEventInput` constraints

**React Components:**
- Check component prop interfaces in same directory
- Validate context provider typing (AuthContext, FeatureFlagContext)
- Ensure children and render props are properly typed
- Use generic constraints for reusable components

**Test Files:**
- Create typed mock factories instead of inline objects
- Use proper test utilities that respect runtime types
- Validate test data matches actual interfaces
- Don't bypass types with `any` - fix the underlying issue

**Service Layer:**
- Check existing service interfaces before adding methods
- Maintain Firebase typing patterns
- Use proper async/await return types
- Validate error handling maintains type safety

#### 3. TypeScript Error Prevention Checklist

**Before Making Changes:**
- [ ] Read all related type definition files
- [ ] Understand discriminated union constraints
- [ ] Check component prop interface requirements
- [ ] Validate context provider patterns

**During Implementation:**
- [ ] Use type guards for union type narrowing
- [ ] Maintain strict null checking
- [ ] Preserve generic type constraints
- [ ] Follow existing error handling patterns

**After Changes:**
- [ ] Run `npx tsc --noEmit` immediately
- [ ] Fix any type errors before continuing
- [ ] Validate tests still compile and pass
- [ ] Check type coverage hasn't decreased

### Common Type Error Patterns

**1. Union Type Mismatches**
```typescript
// WRONG: Mixing event types
const event: WorkspaceEventInput = {
  type: 'data-validation',
  payload: { shortcut: 'Ctrl+S' } // This is KeyboardShortcutEvent payload!
}

// RIGHT: Match payload to event type
const event: WorkspaceEventInput = {
  type: 'data-validation',
  payload: { validationId: 'v1', status: 'valid', errors: [], warnings: [] }
}
```

**2. Context Provider Props**
```typescript
// WRONG: Passing value prop to providers
<AuthProvider value={mockAuth}>

// RIGHT: Use proper provider pattern
<AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>
```

**3. Test Mock Factories**
```typescript
// WRONG: Inline test objects with missing properties
const testEvent = { type: 'schedule-data', action: 'update' };

// RIGHT: Complete typed test factory
const createScheduleDataEvent = (overrides: Partial<ScheduleDataEvent> = {}): ScheduleDataEvent => ({
  id: 'test-id',
  type: 'schedule-data',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  source: 'test',
  priority: 1,
  payload: {
    dataType: 'trips',
    action: 'update',
    data: {},
    ...overrides.payload
  },
  ...overrides
});
```

### Automated Prevention Setup

Add these to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "precommit": "npm run typecheck && npm run lint",
    "ci-check": "tsc --noEmit --strict"
  }
}
```

### Type Coverage Strategy

**Current Issues to Address:**
- Event system union type mismatches in `WorkspaceContext.tsx:532`
- Test file type debt in `integration/*.test.ts` files
- Provider prop type inconsistencies
- Mock factory type safety gaps

**Gradual Migration Plan:**
1. Fix critical union type errors first
2. Create typed test factories
3. Update context provider patterns  
4. Establish type coverage baseline
5. Prevent regression with CI checks

- Implemented simple 25% progress increments (Upload→25%, TimePoints→50%, Blocks→75%, Summary→100%)

#### ✅ Phase 3: State Restoration
- Added `loadDraftWithFullState()` method for complete draft + workflow + stepData loading
- Enhanced DraftLibrary to navigate with full state restoration
- Added state restoration hooks to TimePoints, BlockConfiguration, and BlockSummarySchedule
- Updated WorkflowBreadcrumbs navigation to preserve state between steps
- Created `resumeWorkflow()` for automatic last-step navigation

#### ✅ Phase 4: Resilience & Conflict Resolution
- Implemented offline queue with automatic sync on reconnection
- Added version-based conflict detection and resolution
- Created retry logic with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Built SyncStatusIndicator component for real-time feedback
- Added browser online/offline event handling

#### ✅ Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- Created comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E, performance)
- Achieved < 2s save latency for small drafts, < 10s for large
- Implemented memory management and cleanup
- Added test commands: `npm run test:workflow-persistence`
- Reached 90%+ code coverage on critical paths

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Firebase Collection**: `workflow_progress` stores all workflow state
- **Dual Storage**: Firebase primary with localStorage cache/fallback
- **Atomic Operations**: All saves are transactional with proper error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict type checking
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing drafts seamlessly

### User Experience Now
- ✅ Progress persists across sessions and devices
- ✅ Automatic saving to Firebase on each step completion
- ✅ Works offline with sync when reconnected
- ✅ Simple 25% progress increments per major step
- ✅ Check marks stay checked when reloading drafts
- ✅ **Full state restoration** - Resume exactly where you left off with all data
- ✅ **Draft loading** navigates to last active step automatically
- ✅ **Complete data preservation** - Service bands, block configs, schedules all restored
- ✅ **Resilient to network issues** - Offline queue ensures no data loss
- ✅ **Conflict resolution** - Handles concurrent edits gracefully
- ✅ **Visual sync status** - Real-time feedback on save status
- ✅ **Thoroughly tested** - Comprehensive test suite with 90%+ coverage

### Testing Instructions
To verify the workflow persistence is working:
1. Create a new draft and upload schedule data
2. Complete TimePoints analysis with service bands
3. Configure blocks and generate schedule
4. Close browser completely (or switch to different computer)
5. Open application and load the draft from library
6. Verify: Progress bar shows correct status, all data is restored, you're on the last active step

### Test Commands
```bash
npm run test:workflow-persistence        # Complete test suite
npm run test:workflow-persistence:fast   # Skip performance tests
npm run test:workflow-units             # Unit tests only
