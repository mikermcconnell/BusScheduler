# Trip Duration Analysis Feature - Testing Guide

## âœ… Implementation Complete

**Changed from automatic tab to on-demand button approach as requested.**

### What to expect after uploading a CSV file:

1. **Upload a CSV file** with travel time data (like the example Raw_Data.csv)

2. **Look for the "Trip Duration Analysis" section** - it should appear as a new card below the schedule tables when CSV data is available

3. **Click the "Analyze Trip Duration by Time of Day" button** to generate the analysis

4. **The analysis will expand below** showing:
   - Interactive bar chart with toggle options (median only, key percentiles, all percentiles)
   - Detailed table with trip durations by time period
   - Summary statistics (peak times, fastest times, averages)
   - Color-coded highlighting of peak and fastest periods

### Features:
- **On-Demand Generation**: Only generates when user clicks the button
- **Professional UI**: Clean Material-UI card design with collapsible content
- **Loading State**: Shows "Analyzing..." while processing
- **Interactive Charts**: Multiple view modes for different levels of detail
- **Statistical Insights**: Automatic identification of peak and fastest travel periods
- **Security**: All inputs sanitized using existing security framework

### How it works:
1. Parses CSV data to extract travel time percentiles (25%, 50%, 80%, 90%)
2. Sums all route segments for each time period to get total trip duration
3. Creates analysis with summary statistics
4. Displays as interactive chart and detailed table

The feature is **backward compatible** - works with existing CSV formats that only have 50% and 80% percentiles, but can utilize all 4 percentiles when available.
