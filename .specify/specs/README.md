# Specifications Directory

This directory contains detailed specifications for all features in the Scheduler2 application.

## How to Use

### Creating New Specifications
1. Copy `../.specify/spec-template.md` to this directory
2. Rename to `{feature-name}.md`
3. Fill out all sections completely
4. Get approval before implementation

### Existing Specifications
Each implemented feature should have a corresponding specification file here. If a feature exists but lacks a specification, one should be created retroactively.

### Specification Status
- ✅ **Implemented**: Feature is complete and in production
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
- 📋 **Planned**: Approved for implementation
- 💭 **Draft**: Under review and discussion

## Current Features (Retroactive Specs Needed)
The following features are implemented but need specifications created:

- `auto-save-optimization.md` - Centralized auto-save configuration ✅
- `schedule-generation.md` - Core CSV processing and schedule creation ✅
- `block-configuration.md` - Duolingo-style bus block management UI ✅
- `inline-editing.md` - Recovery time editing with cascading updates ✅
- `firebase-integration.md` - Cloud storage and sync functionality ✅
- `export-functionality.md` - Professional CSV/Excel export ✅
- `security-hardening.md` - XSS prevention and input validation ✅
- `performance-optimization.md` - Virtualization and memory management ✅

## Naming Convention
Use kebab-case for specification files:
- ✅ `user-authentication.md`
- ✅ `dashboard-metrics.md`  
- ❌ `UserAuthentication.md`
- ❌ `Dashboard_Metrics.md`

## Review Process
1. Create specification using template
2. Technical review for feasibility
3. Security review for sensitive features
4. Architecture review for complex changes
5. User acceptance review
6. Implementation approval
