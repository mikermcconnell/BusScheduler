# Spec-Driven Development Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the spec-driven development process for Scheduler2, ensuring high-quality feature delivery through systematic specification and implementation.

## Process Flow

### 1. Feature Request → Specification

    A[Feature Request] --> B[Analysis]
    B --> C[Create Spec]
    C --> D[Review & Approve]
    D --> E[Implementation]
    E --> F[Testing]
    F --> G[Documentation]
    G --> H[Deploy]
```

### 2. Specification Creation Steps

#### Step 1: Analysis Phase
- **Understand the request**: What problem are we solving?
- **Research existing code**: How does this fit with current architecture?
- **Identify dependencies**: What other features/systems are involved?
- **Risk assessment**: What could go wrong?

#### Step 2: Specification Writing
- Use `.specify/spec-template.md` as starting point
- Fill out ALL sections completely
- Include specific technical requirements
- Define measurable success criteria
- Plan testing approach

#### Step 3: Review Process
- **Technical feasibility**: Can we implement this safely?
- **Architecture alignment**: Does this fit our patterns?
- **Security review**: Are there security implications?
- **Performance impact**: How will this affect system performance?
- **User experience**: Does this improve the user experience?

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

#### Before Starting Implementation:
- [ ] Specification approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Technical approach validated
- [ ] Dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Documentation plan created

#### During Implementation:
- [ ] Follow TDD when appropriate
- [ ] Use existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Maintain TypeScript type safety
- [ ] Implement security measures
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests

#### Before Considering Complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### 4. Quality Gates

#### Code Quality
- TypeScript compilation must pass without errors
- ESLint rules must pass
- Test coverage maintains or improves
- No security vulnerabilities introduced

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user paths
- Security tests for input validation

#### Documentation Requirements
- Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes
- Update component documentation
- Update API documentation if applicable
- Create/update user guides

### 5. Agent Utilization Strategy

#### For Specification Creation:
1. **planner-agent**: Break down complex features
2. **security-specialist**: Identify security requirements
3. **performance-optimizer**: Plan performance implications

#### For Implementation:
1. **ui-engineer**: Frontend components
2. **backend-implementer**: Service layer changes
3. **test-engineer**: Comprehensive testing
4. **firebase-specialist**: Database operations

#### For Review:
1. **code-reviewer**: Code quality assurance
2. **security-specialist**: Security validation
3. **performance-optimizer**: Performance impact

### 6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Specification Phase:
- ❌ Vague acceptance criteria
- ❌ Missing security considerations
- ❌ Incomplete technical requirements
- ❌ No testing strategy

#### Implementation Phase:
- ❌ Starting without approved spec
- ❌ Deviating from specification
- ❌ Bypassing type safety
- ❌ Ignoring existing patterns

#### Review Phase:
- ❌ Skipping security review
- ❌ Not testing edge cases
- ❌ Missing documentation updates
- ❌ Not considering backward compatibility

### 7. Success Metrics
- **Specification Quality**: All sections complete, clear acceptance criteria
- **Implementation Speed**: Faster development due to clear requirements
- **Bug Reduction**: Fewer post-deployment issues
- **Maintainability**: Code follows established patterns
- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Templates and Tools
- **Specification Template**: `.specify/spec-template.md`
- **AI Instructions**: `.specify/ai-instructions.md`
- **Project Guidelines**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **Type Definitions**: `src/types/`

Remember: The goal is not more process, but better outcomes through systematic thinking and planning.
